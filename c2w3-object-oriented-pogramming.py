#Object Orientated Programming (OOP)
#Popular examples of OOP: Python, Java, C++.
#OOP is highly modular, making code easy to understand.

#Classes, objects and methods.
#Class - Logical code block, contains attributes(variables) and behaviours(functions).
#Objects - An instance of a class, 
#Methods - Functions defined with a class that determine the behaviour of an instance.

#4 Concepts of OOP
#Inheritance - Creating a new class from an old one. E.g A parent class, can have a child class which is a copy.
#Polymorphism - A single function can act differently depending on te object. E.g str+str concatenates, 1+2 adds.
#Encapsulation - Prevents access to variables and methods by wrapping them in a class.
