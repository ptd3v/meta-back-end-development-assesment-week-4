Git Workflow: 
Working Directory - Modified > (Git Add) > Staging Area > (git commit) > Commited Files/ Folders > (git push) > Remote Repository
After: Remote Repository > (git fetch) > Commited Files
After: Remote Repository > (git checkout) > Working Directory

// The correct workflow is from the working directory to the staging area, then to committed files, remote repository and lastly to your colleague.
